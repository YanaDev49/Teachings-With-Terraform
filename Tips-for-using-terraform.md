# Top Tips For Using Terraform ♾️

## Terraform Documentation

#### Terraform documentation is super important because it helps you understand how to use the tool properly. When you’re working with Terraform, you often need to look up how to configure resources, set variables, or write certain functions, and the docs give you all the details you need to do that.

- For example, if you want to create an AWS instance or set up a network, the Terraform docs will show you the exact syntax and options to use.
  
- It’s like a guidebook that makes sure you’re doing things the right way, avoiding mistakes, and getting your infrastructure set up quickly.

## Terraform Registry

#### The Terraform Registry is super useful because it’s like a big library of pre-built modules and providers that you can use in your projects.

- Instead of writing everything from scratch, you can find modules for things like setting up AWS services, databases, or Kubernetes clusters, and just plug them into your Terraform code.

- It saves you a lot of time and effort, especially when working with complex infrastructure. Plus, the registry helps you see how other people have solved similar problems, which can give you a head start on your own setups.

## Testing Validation

#### Testing and validation in Terraform are important because they help you catch mistakes before they affect your actual infrastructure. When you're managing cloud resources, a small error in your code can cause big problems, like downtime or misconfigurations.

- By testing your Terraform code, you can make sure it’s doing exactly what you expect before you apply it. Validation helps check that your syntax is correct and that your configuration will work as intended.

## Start with an MVP then iterate

MVP stands for 'Minimum Viable Product' and this means confguring the resource that you need in order to deploy it into the cloud and then you could iterate.

- This is where you can focus on implemeting variables or maybe turning your code into a terraform module.

## Implement Dry Software engineering principle

#### The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in Terraform means writing your infrastructure code in a way that avoids repetition. Instead of copying the same blocks of code for similar resources, you can use variables, modules, or loops to reuse code.

- For example, if you need to create multiple servers, you don’t have to repeat the same code for each one. By applying the DRY principle, you keep your code cleaner, easier to manage, and less prone to mistakes.
