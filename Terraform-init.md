Downloads Providers: Terraform checks what cloud providers you’re using (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) in your code and downloads the necessary plugins (called "providers"). This makes sure Terraform knows how to interact with that specific cloud provider.

### Example: If you’re working with AWS, terraform init will download the AWS plugin.

- Sets Up Backend (Optional): If you're storing your Terraform state file remotely (like in S3), it will configure that too. The "state" is how Terraform keeps track of what’s already been built, so it knows what to update, add, or remove.

Prepares Your Directory: Terraform creates a folder called '.terraform', where it stores all the downloaded plugins and other necessary files. This is so you don’t need to keep downloading them each time.

### Think of terraform init like getting your toolbox ready before starting a job. It makes sure you have all the right tools (providers and plugins) and prepares your workspace so Terraform can start building or managing resources.


## What happens when you run it:

$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding hashicorp/aws versions matching ">= 2.7.0"...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v3.44.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v3.44.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure.
