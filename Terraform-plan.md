### The command terraform plan allows you to see what your changes will do.

Terraform analyses your configuration files, compares them to the current state of your infrastructure and then generates a plan  

### essentially, terraform plan is like a preview of what Terraform is going to do. It checks your code and shows you what changes itâ€™s about to make to your infrastructure before actually doing anything. It's a safe way to see what will happen without making any changes yet.

- What Happens When You Run terraform plan:
  
Checks the code: Terraform looks at your configuration (the .tf files you wrote) to see what resources you want to create, update, or delete.

Compares with the current state: It checks what already exists in your cloud provider (like AWS) by comparing with your state file (a file that tracks your existing infrastructure).

Shows you the plan: Terraform then gives you a "plan" â€” listing what itâ€™s going to create, update, or delete.
