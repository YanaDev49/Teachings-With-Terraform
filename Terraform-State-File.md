#### your terraform statefile is a record of your existing infrastructure. Its an up to date record of your actual state. This is crucial because it helps ensure idempotency.

When it comes to terraform, Idempotency means that your terraform configuration will produce the same result no matter how many times you run it will produce the same result. it wouldnt deploy things 
multiple times and the result will be the same. If you make a particular change to your configuration, it would not cause a complete change, it will just apply that particular change. And if you make a particular change to your terraform configuration, that change will be applied.

#### That is the concept of Idempotency in terraform 

- Idempotency is a very important word which showcases knowledge of terraform

 ## Desired State VS Current State

- We already said how your Terraform state file is a file that keeps track of your infrastructure's current state. For example if you want to deploy an ec2 instance everything (details will be on your state file 

- your desired state however is your terraform configuration of changes your trying to deploy it

- The terraform state file compares your desired state file to your actual infrastructure, and thats how terraform decides on what to do

Lets say you've added an additional EC2 instance in your desired state which is your terraform configuration, your TF State file would compare this and recognise that there are only a certain number of EC2 instances and  youve added another one. Now we need to deploy an additional one in order to match the desired state and current state 

### In summary, the desired state is what you're trying to achieve and your current state is what actually exists.
