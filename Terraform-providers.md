# What are terraform providers? 


Terraform providers are essential plugins that allow Terraform to interact with different services and platforms. They act as a bridge between Terraform and the cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud), as well as other services like databases, monitoring tools, or even DNS management.

For example, if youâ€™re using AWS, the AWS provider lets Terraform create, update, and manage resources like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and more. Providers define the available resources and how Terraform should interact with them.

In summary providers tell Terraform how to talk to and control specific services. Without them, Terraform wouldn't know how to manage your infrastructure!
